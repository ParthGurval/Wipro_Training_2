Example:

Corporate Network: A multinational corporation with offices in different countries uses a WAN to connect its global offices, enabling employees to communicate, share resources, and access centralized systems and databases.






Client-Server Architecture
Definition:
Client-server architecture is a network design where multiple clients (devices or applications) request and receive services from a central server (a powerful computer or program).

Characteristics:

Centralized Control: The server manages resources, stores data, and processes client requests.
Scalability: Can be scaled by adding more servers to handle increased loads.
Security: Easier to implement security measures since data and resources are centrally managed.
Reliability: Server redundancy and backup systems can improve reliability.
Components:

Client: Devices or applications that request services from the server. Examples include personal computers, smartphones, and tablets.
Server: A powerful computer or program that provides services such as file storage, email, web hosting, and databases.
How It Works:

Client Request: A client sends a request to the server for a specific service or resource.
Server Response: The server processes the request and sends the appropriate response or resource back to the client.
Example:

Web Browsing: A web browser (client) requests a web page from a web server. The server processes the request and sends the web page back to the browser for display.
Email: An email client requests new emails from the email server, which then sends the emails to the client.
Advantages:

Centralized Resources: Easier to manage and update data and applications centrally.
Enhanced Security: Centralized control allows for better implementation of security policies and access control.
Scalability: Can handle a large number of clients by adding more servers or upgrading existing ones.

Cost: Setting up and maintaining powerful servers can be expensive.
Performance Bottlenecks: High demand can cause performance issues if the server is not adequately scaled.


Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture
Definition:
Peer-to-peer architecture is a decentralized network design where each device (peer) has equal capabilities and responsibilities, sharing resources directly with other peers without the need for a central server.

Characteristics:

Decentralized Control: No central server; all peers are both clients and servers.
Resource Sharing: Each peer shares its resources, such as files and processing power, directly with other peers.
Scalability: Naturally scalable, as adding more peers increases the network's overall capacity.
Resilience: More resilient to failures, as the failure of one peer does not affect the availability of resources on other peers.
Components:

Peer: A device that can act both as a client requesting resources and as a server providing resources. Examples include personal computers and smartphones.
How It Works:

Resource Discovery: Peers discover other peers on the network and establish direct connections.
Resource Sharing: Peers share files, data, or other resources directly with one another without a central server.
Example:

File Sharing: BitTorrent is a P2P protocol where users share pieces of files directly with each other, distributing the load and speeding up downloads.
VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol): Applications like Skype use P2P architecture to connect users directly for voice and video calls.
Advantages:

Decentralization: No central point of failure, making the network more robust and resilient.
Cost-Effective: No need for expensive central servers, as resources are distributed among peers.
Scalability: Adding more peers increases the network's capacity without significant changes to the architecture.
Disadvantages:

Security: Harder to implement consistent security policies due to the decentralized nature.
Management: More challenging to manage and control the network since there is no central authority.
Performance Variability: The performance can vary depending on the capabilities and availability of the individual peers.
