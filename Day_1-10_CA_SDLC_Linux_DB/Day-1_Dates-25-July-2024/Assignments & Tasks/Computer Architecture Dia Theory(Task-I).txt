1. CPU:

	The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer. 
	It is responsible for executing instructions from programs, performing calculations, and managing data flow within the computer system. 
	The CPU is has some key components: the Control Unit (CU), the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and Registers.

	1.1 Control Unit (CU):
	
		The Control Unit is the component of the CPU that directs the operation of the processor.
		The CU retrieves instructions from memory and decodes them to determine the necessary actions.
		It manages the flow of data between the CPU and other parts of the computer, including memory and input/output devices.
		It sends control signals to the ALU and other components to execute the instructions.
		
	1.2 Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):
	
		The Arithmetic Logic Unit is the part of the CPU that performs all arithmetic and logical operations.
		Handles basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
		Performs logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR.
		Compares numbers to determine equality, greater than, or less than.
		
	1.3 Registers:
	
		Registers are small, fast storage locations within the CPU used to hold data temporarily.
		It is Used to hold temporary data and intermediate results.
		Includes the Program Counter (PC), which holds the address of the next instruction to execute, and the Instruction Register (IR), which holds the current instruction.
		It Temporarily holds data and instructions that are currently being used or processed by the CPU.
		It Provides the CPU with quick access to frequently used values and instructions, improving processing speed.
		
2. Input Devices:

	Input devices are peripherals used to provide data and control signals to a computer system.
	
	Examples:

		Keyboard: Allows the user to input text and commands.
		Mouse: A pointing device used to interact with the graphical user interface.
	
	Functions:

		Data Entry: Enables users to input raw data into the computer.
		Command Execution: Allows users to execute commands and control the computer system.

	Connection:

		Input devices send data to the Control Unit (CU), which processes the input and directs it to the appropriate components within the CPU or memory for further action.

3. Output Devices:

	Output devices are peripherals used to communicate the results of data processing carried out by a computer to the user.
	
	Examples:

		Monitor: Displays visual output from the computer.
		Printer: Produces physical copies of digital documents.
		
	Functions:

		Data Presentation: Presents processed data to the user in a readable or perceivable form.
		Feedback: Provides feedback to the user about the operations performed by the computer.
		
	Connection:

		The Control Unit (CU) sends processed data from the CPU to output devices, which then convert this data into a human-perceivable format.
		
4. Main Memory (RAM): 

	Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of volatile memory used to store data and instructions temporarily while they are being processed by the CPU.
	
	Functions:

		Temporary Storage: Holds data and instructions that the CPU needs while performing tasks.
		Quick Access: Provides the CPU with fast access to data, enhancing processing speed and efficiency.

	Connection:

		The Control Unit (CU) fetches data and instructions from RAM for processing by the CPU and stores intermediate results back in RAM. 
		RAM also interfaces with secondary memory to transfer data as needed.
	
5. Secondary Memory

	 Secondary memory refers to non-volatile storage used to store data and programs permanently.
	 
	 Examples:

		Hard Disk Drives (HDDs): Magnetic storage devices with large capacity.
		Solid State Drives (SSDs): Faster storage devices using flash memory.
		Optical Discs: CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs used for media storage.
		USB Flash Drives: Portable storage devices.

	Functions:

		Permanent Storage: Stores data and programs not currently in use by the CPU.
		Backup: Provides a means to back up important data for long-term retention.
		Data Transfer: Facilitates the transfer of large amounts of data between systems.
		
	Connection:

	The Control Unit (CU) manages data transfer between RAM and secondary memory, loading programs and data into RAM for processing and saving results back to secondary memory for long-term storage.

Data Connections Process/Flow:

1. Input Devices send data and instructions to the Control Unit (CU).
2. Control Unit (CU) manages and directs data flow between the CPU, memory, and input/output devices.
3. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) performs operations on data retrieved from Registers.
4. Registers hold data temporarily for quick access by the ALU.
5. Memory (RAM) stores data and instructions for quick access by the CPU.
6. Secondary Memory (Storage) holds data and programs long-term and transfers data to and from RAM as needed.
7. Output Devices receive processed data from the CPU via the Control Unit (CU).
