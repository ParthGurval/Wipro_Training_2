What is RDBMS and list it's Advantages and Dis-Advantages

	- A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a type of database management system that stores and manages data in a structured format using tables, rows, and columns. 
	- It is based on the relational model, which organizes data into one or more tables, with each table having rows and columns. 
	- Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a field or attribute of that record.
	
	In RDBMS, information is stored in tables, like spreadsheets. Each table has rows and columns, like a grid.

	- Rows: Each row represents a single record, like a person's information.
	- Columns: Each column represents a field or attribute, like name, address, or phone number.
	
	Key Features of RDBMS:

	- Tables: Information is stored in tables, making it easy to organize and find data.
	- Relationships: Tables can be connected to each other using relationships, like a person's address being linked to their name.
	- Primary Key: Each row has a unique identifier, like a name or ID number, that helps find specific information.
	- Foreign Key: A foreign key is a field in one table that links to the primary key in another table, creating a relationship between them.
	
	Real-Life Example:

	- Imagine a library with thousands of books. An RDBMS can help the librarian:

		- Store book information, like title, author, and publication date, in a table.
		- Create relationships between books, authors, and publishers.
		
	Advantages of RDBMS:
	
	- Improved Data Integrity: RDBMS ensures data consistency and accuracy by enforcing data relationships and constraints.
	- Data Security: RDBMS provides robust security features, such as access control and encryption, to protect sensitive data.
	- Scalability: RDBMS can handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally to support growing applications.
	- Standardization: RDBMS follows standardized query languages, such as SQL, making it easy to learn and use.
	- Data Sharing: RDBMS enables multiple users to access and share data simultaneously.
	- Backup and Recovery: RDBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering data in case of failures or data loss.
	- Data Normalization: RDBMS supports data normalization, which eliminates data redundancy and improves data organization.
	
	Dis-Advantages od RDBMS:
	
	- Complexity: Can be complicated to set up and manage, especially for large databases with many tables and relationships.
	- Performance: Might slow down with very large amounts of data or complex queries, requiring optimization.
	- Cost: Some RDBMS software can be expensive, particularly for enterprise-level systems.
	- Overhead: Managing and maintaining an RDBMS requires significant resources, including hardware and administrative effort.
	- Schema Rigidity: Changing the database schema (structure) after it’s set up can be difficult and disruptive.
	
	
Explain ER Model, what is ER model, what is entity and attribute types of entity and attributes and their diagram representation 

ER Model 
	- The ER Model, or Entity-Relationship Model, is a way to visually represent and design the structure of a database. 
	- It helps in organizing and defining the data requirements and relationships in a system.

	Key Concepts of the ER Model
	
	1. Entities:
		- Definition: An entity is an object or thing in the real world that is distinguishable from other objects. 
					  Entities can be physical objects (like a person or car) or concepts (like a course or a project).
		- Types:
				Strong Entity: An entity that can exist independently (e.g., Student, Employee).
				Weak Entity: An entity that cannot exist without a strong entity (e.g., OrderItem might depend on Order).
				Physical Entities
					Definition: Physical entities are tangible, real-world objects or items that exist and can be physically interacted with or observed. In a database context, these are often the items that are stored, tracked, or managed.
					Examples:
					Person: A specific individual, such as an employee or a student.
					Product: A tangible item like a laptop or a book.
					Building: An actual structure, such as a company office or a library.
				Non-Physical Entities
					Definition: Non-physical entities are abstract concepts, ideas, or roles that do not have a tangible, physical presence but are important for modeling relationships and interactions within a system.
					Examples:
					Course: An educational course, which is a concept rather than a physical object.
					Project: A project that exists as a plan or an idea, not a physical object.
					Event: An occurrence or activity, such as a meeting or a conference.

	2. Attributes:

	- Definition: Attributes are properties or details about an entity. For example, a Student entity might have attributes like StudentID, Name, and DateOfBirth.
	- Types:
			Simple Attribute: Cannot be divided further (e.g., FirstName, Age).
			Composite Attribute: Can be divided into smaller sub-parts (e.g., Address can be divided into Street, City, ZipCode).
			Derived Attribute: Can be calculated from other attributes (e.g., Age can be derived from DateOfBirth).
			Single Value Attribute: It has only one attribute (eg: degree)
			Multi-valued Attribute: Can have multiple values (e.g., PhoneNumbers for a person).

	3. Relationships:

	- Definition: A relationship is an association between entities. For example, a Student might be related to a Course through an Enrollment relationship.
	- Types:
			One-to-One (1:1): A single instance of Entity A is related to a single instance of Entity B (e.g., a Person and a Passport).
			One-to-Many (1
							): A single instance of Entity A is related to multiple instances of Entity B (e.g., a Teacher and multiple Courses).
			Many-to-Many (M
					): Multiple instances of Entity A are related to multiple instances of Entity B (e.g., Students and Courses).

	ER Diagram Representation
		An ER Diagram visually represents entities, attributes, and relationships using symbols and connectors:

	Entities:

		Represented by rectangles.
		Labelled with the name of the entity (e.g., Student).

	Attributes:

		Represented by ovals connected to their entity rectangle.
		Labelled with the name of the attribute (e.g., Name, StudentID).

	Relationships:

		Represented by diamonds.
		Connected to the entities involved using lines.
		Labelled with the name of the relationship (e.g., Enrolls).

	Cardinality:

		Indicates how many instances of an entity relate to another entity.
		Shown using numbers or symbols near the lines connecting entities (e.g., 1, M, N).
		
		
Logical and Physical Database

	Logical Database
	
		Definition: 
			- A logical database is a way of organizing data that focuses on how data is structured and related to each other. 
			- It deals with the design and relationships of the data without worrying about how it's actually stored or managed on a computer.

		Focus:

			- Data Structure: How data is logically organized into tables, fields, and relationships.
			- Data Relationships: How different pieces of data relate to each other (e.g., a customer’s orders).
			- Constraints: Rules that ensure data integrity, like preventing duplicate records.
			- Purpose: Helps in designing the database schema and understanding what data is needed and how it connects. It's more about planning and design.

		Example: Imagine you’re designing a database for a library. 
				In the logical design, you define entities like Books, Authors, and Members, and relationships like Borrowed between Books and Members.
				
	Physical Database

		Definition: 
			- A physical database is about how data is actually stored on a computer's hardware. 
			- It deals with the technical details of data storage, retrieval, and performance.

		Focus:

			- Data Storage: How and where data is stored on disk drives or other storage devices.
			- Indexing: Techniques to speed up data retrieval (like creating an index in a book to find specific topics quickly).
			- Performance: Optimizing how data is read from and written to storage to ensure the database runs efficiently.
			- Data Access Methods: The technical mechanisms used to access and manipulate the data.
			- Purpose: Focuses on the implementation and efficiency of storing and retrieving data. It's more about practical, technical details.

		Example: 
		
			Continuing with the library example, the physical design would involve deciding how to store book records in files, how to index them for quick 
			searching, and how to ensure that multiple people can access the database quickly without slowing down.

		Summary

		- Logical Database: Think of it as the blueprint or design of the database. It’s how the data is structured and related conceptually.
		- Physical Database: Think of it as the construction and management of the actual database. It’s how the data is stored, accessed, and optimized on hardware.
		
		
Normalization:

	- Normalization is a process used in database design to organize data in a way that reduces redundancy (repeated data) and improves data integrity (accuracy and consistency). 
	- The goal is to make sure that the database is efficient and that data is stored in a logical and structured manner.

	What is Normalization?
		Purpose: To make sure data is stored in such a way that it avoids duplication and minimizes the risk of anomalies (errors) when inserting, updating, or deleting data.
		Process: Involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between them.

	Simple Explanation and Example
		Imagine you have a simple database for a small online store. Initially, you might have a single table with customer orders that looks like this:

		OrderID	CustomerName	CustomerAddress	ProductName	Quantity
		1	Alice Smith	123 Elm St	Laptop	1
		2	Bob Johnson	456 Oak St	Phone	2
		3	Alice Smith	123 Elm St	Mouse	1
		
	Problems with this table:

		Redundancy: Customer information (like CustomerName and CustomerAddress) is repeated for each order.
		Update Anomalies: If Alice Smith changes her address, it has to be updated in multiple places.
		Normalization fixes these issues by breaking the data into separate tables.
		
	1NF: Ensures atomic values and unique rows.
	2NF: Eliminates partial dependencies, ensuring non-key attributes are dependent on the entire key.
	3NF: Removes transitive dependencies, ensuring non-key attributes depend only on the primary key.
	4NF: Addresses multi-valued dependencies, ensuring no attribute has multiple independent values.
	
	Example Scenario:
	
	Imagine a table that tracks student enrollments in courses:

	StudentID	StudentName	CourseTitle	InstructorName	InstructorPhone
	1	John Doe	Math 101	Dr. Smith	555-1234
	1	John Doe	History 201	Dr. Jones	555-5678
	2	Jane Roe	Math 101	Dr. Smith	555-1234
	2	Jane Roe	Science 301	Dr. Brown	555-8765

	1NF (First Normal Form)

		Definition: Ensure each column contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and each row is unique.

		Example: The above table is in 1NF because:

		Each field contains only one value (e.g., InstructorPhone is a single phone number).
		Each row is unique.
		
		Key Points:

		No repeating groups or arrays.
		Each cell in the table has a single value.
		
	2NF (Second Normal Form)
		Definition: Ensure the table is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key, not just part of it.

		Example: In our table, the primary key is a composite key made up of StudentID and CourseTitle. The attributes InstructorName and InstructorPhone depend on CourseTitle, not StudentID. So, to achieve 2NF, we need to split the table:

		StudentCourses Table:

		StudentID	CourseTitle
		1	Math 101
		1	History 201
		2	Math 101
		2	Science 301
		Courses Table:

		CourseTitle	InstructorName	InstructorPhone
		Math 101	Dr. Smith	555-1234
		History 201	Dr. Jones	555-5678
		Science 301	Dr. Brown	555-8765
		Key Points:

		Removes partial dependencies.
		Non-key attributes are dependent on the entire composite key.
		
		
	3NF (Third Normal Form)
		Definition: Ensure the table is in 2NF and all non-key attributes are not only fully dependent on the primary key but also non-transitively dependent (i.e., non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes).

		Example: In the Courses Table, InstructorPhone depends on InstructorName, not directly on CourseTitle. To achieve 3NF, we should further normalize:

		Courses Table:

		CourseTitle	InstructorID
		Math 101	1
		History 201	2
		Science 301	3
		Instructors Table:

		InstructorID	InstructorName	InstructorPhone
		1	Dr. Smith	555-1234
		2	Dr. Jones	555-5678
		3	Dr. Brown	555-8765
		Key Points:

		Removes transitive dependencies.
		Ensures that every non-key attribute depends only on the primary key.
		
	4NF (Fourth Normal Form)
		Definition: Ensure the table is in 3NF and there are no multi-valued dependencies. This means that a record should not have more than one independent multi-valued attribute.

		Example: Suppose each course can have multiple prerequisites. We need to ensure that the table does not contain multiple multi-valued attributes:

		Courses Table:

		CourseTitle	InstructorID
		Math 101	1
		History 201	2
		Science 301	3
		CoursePrerequisites Table:

		CourseTitle	PrerequisiteCourse
		Math 101	None
		History 201	Math 101
		Science 301	Math 101
		Key Points:

		Eliminates multi-valued dependencies.
		Ensures that each attribute is only dependent on the primary key and not on another multi-valued attribute.


Terminologies:

	Single-User System: One user at a time interacts with the database.
	Multi-User System: Multiple users can interact with the database simultaneously.
	Centralized Database: Data is stored in a single location, which is accessed by users through a network.
	Distributed Database: Data is distributed across multiple locations or servers, providing scalability and fault tolerance.
	
	Single-User System
		
		- Definition: A single-user system is a type of database system designed to be accessed and used by one user at a time.
		
		- Characteristics:
			- Use Case: Often used in personal applications or small-scale environments where only one person needs to interact with the database.
			- Examples: Desktop applications like Microsoft Access or small personal databases.
			- Performance: Typically optimized for single-user access, so performance and data integrity issues related to concurrent access are not a concern.

	Multi-User System
		
		- Definition: A multi-user system allows multiple users to access and interact with the database simultaneously.
		
		- Characteristics:
			- Use Case: Common in business environments, web applications, and organizations where many people need to read or modify the database at the same time.
			- Examples: Enterprise systems like Oracle Database, MySQL, or Microsoft SQL Server.
			- Concurrency Control: Includes mechanisms to handle simultaneous access by multiple users, such as transaction management, locking, and isolation levels to ensure data consistency and integrity.

	Centralized Database
		
		- Definition: A centralized database is stored and managed in a single location or server, which can be accessed by users or applications through a network.
		
		- Characteristics:
			- Use Case: Suitable for environments where all data needs to be controlled and maintained from a single point.
			- Examples: A single corporate database server where all company data is stored and managed.
			- Advantages: Easier to manage, secure, and back up since everything is in one place.
			- Disadvantages: May become a bottleneck if many users access it simultaneously; can be a single point of failure.

	Distributed Database
		
		- Definition: A distributed database is spread across multiple physical locations or servers, which may be connected over a network.
		
		- Characteristics:
			- Use Case: Useful for large-scale applications that need to handle data across different geographical locations or for load balancing.
			- Examples: Systems like Google's Bigtable or Amazon DynamoDB, which spread data across various servers to enhance performance and reliability.
			- Advantages: Increased reliability and fault tolerance (if one node fails, others can take over); can handle high volumes of data and user requests.
			- Disadvantages: More complex to manage and synchronize data across different locations; can be more challenging to ensure consistency and data integrity.
			

Client Server Architecture:

	Client-Server Architecture

		- Client-server architecture is a computing model in which multiple clients (users or devices) connect to a central server to access resources and services. 
		
		- Here's a simple breakdown:

			- Client: The client is a device or application that requests services or resources from the server. Examples of clients include web browsers, email clients, and mobile apps.
			- Server: The server is a powerful computer or application that provides services or resources to clients. Examples of servers include web servers, database servers, and file servers.

	- How It Works:
		- Client sends a request: The client sends a request to the server for some service or resource.
		- Server processes the request: The server processes the request, which might involve querying a database, processing data, or fetching a file.
		- Server sends a response: The server sends back the requested data or a response indicating the result of the request to the client.
		
		+---------+     Request     +---------+
		| Client  |  ------------>  | Server  |
		| Device  |  <------------  |         |
		+---------+    Response     +---------+


Important Concepts:

	1. Table
		- Definition: A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns. It represents a specific entity or type of information in a relational database.
		- Example: A "Students" table might contain information about students, with each row representing a student and each column representing an attribute like name, age, or grade.

	2. Rows
		- Definition: Rows, also known as records or tuples, are horizontal collections of data in a table. Each row represents a single, distinct record or entity.
		- Example: In the "Students" table, each row might represent a single student, with information like "John Doe, 20, A".

	3. Columns
		- Definition: Columns, also known as fields or attributes, are vertical collections of data in a table. Each column represents a specific attribute or property of the table's entities.
		- Example: In the "Students" table, columns might include "Name", "Age", and "Grade".

	4. Fields
		- Definition: Fields are the individual data items within a table, located at the intersection of a row and a column. Each field contains a single piece of data.
		- Example: In the "Students" table, the field in the first row under the "Name" column might contain "John Doe".

	5. Primary Key
		- Definition: A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and retrieved.
		- Example: In the "Students" table, a primary key might be a "Student ID" that uniquely identifies each student.

	6. Foreign Key
		- Definition: A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key of another table. It creates a relationship between the two tables.
		- Example: In a "Enrollments" table, the "Student ID" might be a foreign key that links to the "Student ID" primary key in the "Students" table.

	7. Indices
		- Definition: Indices are database objects that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. They are created on columns to allow quick search and access to data.
		- Example: An index on the "Name" column of the "Students" table would allow for faster searches when looking up students by name.
		
	8. Index: 
	
		- An index in a database is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. 
		- Think of it as a sorted list that allows quick access to the data rows in a table, similar to an index in a book that helps you quickly find information.
		
		
Database Constraints

	- Constraints are rules enforced on data columns in a database to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. 
	- Here are explanations of common constraints: Not Null, Unique, Check, and Default.

	1. Not Null

		- Definition: The Not Null constraint ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value. Every record must have a value for this column.
		- Purpose: To guarantee that a column always contains a valid value, which is essential for the integrity of the data.
		- Example: In a table of users, the email column might be set to Not Null to ensure every user has an email address.

		sql
		CREATE TABLE Users (
			UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
			Username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
			Email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
		);


	2. Unique

		- Definition: The Unique constraint ensures that all values in a column are distinct. No two rows can have the same value in this column.
		- Purpose: To prevent duplicate values in a column and ensure data uniqueness.
		- Example: In a table of users, the username column might be set to Unique to ensure no two users can have the same username.

		sql
		CREATE TABLE Users (
			UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
			Username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
			Email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
		);


	3. Check

		- Definition: The Check constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
		- Purpose: To enforce domain integrity by limiting the values that can be stored in a column.
		- Example: In a table of employees, the salary column might have a Check constraint to ensure all salaries are greater than zero.

		sql
		CREATE TABLE Employees (
			EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
			Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
			Salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (Salary > 0)
		);


	4. Default

		- Definition: The Default constraint provides a default value for a column when no value is specified.
		- Purpose: To ensure that a column always has a value, even if one is not explicitly provided during the insertion of a record.
		- Example: In a table of products, the date_added column might have a default value of the current date.

		sql
		CREATE TABLE Products (
			ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
			ProductName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
			DateAdded DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
		);


	Summary

		- Not Null: Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.
		- Unique: Ensures all values in a column are distinct.
		- Check: Ensures all values in a column meet a specific condition.
		- Default: Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.

	These constraints help maintain the integrity, accuracy, and consistency of the data within a database.
	
ACID Properties

	ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties ensure reliable processing of database transactions. Here's a detailed explanation in simple words:

	1. Atomicity
		- Definition: Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit, which either completely succeeds or completely fails. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database remains unchanged.
		- Purpose: To ensure that partial transactions do not corrupt the database.
		- Example: If you are transferring money from one bank account to another, the transaction involves debiting one account and crediting another. Atomicity ensures that either both actions happen, or neither happens.

	2. Consistency
		- Definition: Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another valid state, maintaining database rules and constraints.
		- Purpose: To ensure that only valid data is written to the database.
		- Example: If a database rule states that an account balance cannot be negative, any transaction that results in a negative balance will be rolled back to maintain consistency.

	3. Isolation
		- Definition: Isolation ensures that transactions are executed in isolation from each other. The intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions until it is completed.
		- Purpose: To prevent transactions from interfering with each other.
		- Example: If two transactions are trying to update the same account balance at the same time, isolation ensures that they are processed sequentially, not simultaneously, to avoid conflicts.

	4. Durability
		- Definition: Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, it is permanently recorded in the database, even in the case of a system failure.
		- Purpose: To guarantee that committed transactions are not lost.
		- Example: After a successful money transfer, even if the system crashes, the records of the transaction will still be there when the system is back up.

	Summary with an Example:

		Imagine you are booking a flight ticket online:
			1. Atomicity: If your booking involves reserving a seat and deducting money from your account, either both actions complete successfully, or neither does. If there's an issue with the payment, the seat reservation is canceled.
			2. Consistency: If the booking system has a rule that no more than 100 seats can be booked for a flight, this rule will be upheld. If a transaction violates this rule, it will be rolled back.
			3. Isolation: If you and someone else are booking the last seat on a flight simultaneously, isolation ensures that one of you completes the booking first without interference, preventing both from booking the same seat.
			4. Durability: Once your booking is confirmed and you receive a ticket, the transaction is saved permanently. Even if the system crashes right after, your booking remains intact.

	These ACID properties are crucial for ensuring the reliability and integrity of transactions in a database.
	
	
	
Locks In Databases

	Locks are mechanisms used in databases to control how multiple transactions interact with the same data at the same time. They prevent conflicts and ensure data integrity during concurrent access.

	Types of Locks

		1. Shared Lock (S Lock)
		   - Definition: A shared lock allows multiple transactions to read the same data concurrently but prevents any transaction from modifying the data.
		   - Purpose: To enable concurrent read access while ensuring the data is not changed during the reading process.
		   - Example: If two transactions need to read the same record simultaneously, both can acquire shared locks on that record, allowing both reads to happen without conflict.

		2. Exclusive Lock (X Lock)
		   - Definition: An exclusive lock allows only one transaction to modify the data. It prevents other transactions from reading or modifying the data until the exclusive lock is released.
		   - Purpose: To ensure that no other transactions interfere with the data while it is being modified.
		   - Example: If a transaction needs to update a record, it will acquire an exclusive lock on that record. While the lock is held, no other transaction can read or modify the record.

		3. Concurrency Lock
		   - Definition: Concurrency locks are a broader category that includes various types of locks (like shared and exclusive) used to manage concurrent access to database resources.
		   - Purpose: To manage simultaneous access to database resources and ensure consistency and isolation in transactions.
		   - Example: Concurrency control mechanisms use shared and exclusive locks, along with other techniques, to handle multiple transactions accessing the same data concurrently without conflicts.

	How Locks Work

		When a transaction wants to access a database resource (e.g., a row or table), it requests a lock. 
		
		The type of lock depends on the operation:
			- Read Operation: A shared lock is requested. Multiple transactions can hold shared locks on the same resource simultaneously.
			- Write Operation: An exclusive lock is requested. Only one transaction can hold an exclusive lock on a resource, blocking other transactions from reading or writing to the same resource.

	Locking Scenarios

		1. Shared Lock Example:
		   - Transaction A and Transaction B both want to read a record.
		   - Both transactions acquire a shared lock on the record.
		   - Both can read the record simultaneously.

		2. Exclusive Lock Example:
		   - Transaction C wants to update a record.
		   - It acquires an exclusive lock on the record.
		   - While Transaction C holds the lock, other transactions (e.g., Transaction D) cannot read or write to the record.
		   - After Transaction C completes the update and releases the lock, other transactions can access the record.

	Importance of Locks

		Locks are essential for maintaining data consistency and isolation in a multi-user database environment. They prevent issues such as:

		- Dirty Reads: Reading uncommitted changes from another transaction.
		- Non-repeatable Reads: Data changes between reads in the same transaction.
		- Phantom Reads: New records appear or existing ones disappear between reads in the same transaction.

	Locks help in achieving the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) of database transactions by managing concurrent access effectively.
	
	
	Simplistic Lock Protocol

	
		- Definition: The simplistic lock protocol is a straightforward method for handling concurrency in a database. It requires a transaction to request all the locks it needs before it begins executing.
		- Purpose: To ensure that once a transaction starts, it will not encounter any lock conflicts since it already holds all necessary locks.
		- Example: Imagine a transaction needs to update two records. Using the simplistic lock protocol, the transaction will first request locks for both records. If it gets the locks, it proceeds with the updates; if not, it waits until it can obtain all the required locks.

		- Advantages:
			- Simple to implement and understand.
			- Prevents deadlocks because all locks are acquired upfront.

		- Disadvantages:
			- Can lead to reduced concurrency because a transaction might hold locks for longer than necessary.
			- May cause delays if a transaction has to wait for all required locks to become available before starting.
	
	
	
	
	
	Pre-Claiming Lock Protocol
	
		- Definition: The pre-claiming lock protocol is an approach where a transaction evaluates the locks it will need and requests all of them at the start, before executing any operation. If the system grants all the requested locks, the transaction proceeds; otherwise, it waits or is rolled back.
		- Purpose: To avoid deadlocks and ensure that a transaction will not be blocked mid-way due to lock conflicts.
		- Example: For a transaction that involves transferring money from one account to another, the pre-claiming lock protocol requires that the transaction request locks on both accounts at the beginning. If both locks are granted, the transaction proceeds with the transfer; if not, it waits or is aborted.
	
	Advantages:
		- Prevents deadlocks by ensuring all necessary locks are acquired before the transaction starts.
		- Simplifies transaction execution since all locks are pre-acquired.

	Disadvantages:

		- Similar to the simplistic lock protocol, it can lead to lower concurrency as transactions may hold locks longer than needed.
		- May cause longer wait times if locks are not available at the transaction's start.


	Comparison
		- Both protocols aim to prevent deadlocks by requiring transactions to acquire all needed locks upfront.
		- The simplistic lock protocol is more rigid in requiring all locks to be requested before any operations, whereas pre-claiming involves a more strategic evaluation of needed locks.






Concurrency Lock Protocols

		- Concurrency lock protocols are rules that determine how transactions acquire and release locks in a database to ensure consistency and isolation. 
		- These protocols help manage concurrent access to the database and prevent conflicts between transactions.


	Key Concurrency Lock Protocols

		1. Two-Phase Locking (2PL)
		   - Definition: This protocol divides the transaction's life into two phases: the growing phase and the shrinking phase.
			 - Growing Phase: A transaction can acquire locks but cannot release any.
			 - Shrinking Phase: A transaction can release locks but cannot acquire any new ones.
		   - Purpose: To ensure serializability, which means that the result of executing transactions concurrently is the same as if they were executed serially (one after the other).
		   - Example: Imagine you are reserving a flight and booking a hotel room. In the growing phase, you acquire locks for both reservations. In the shrinking phase, you release the locks after both reservations are confirmed.

		2. Strict Two-Phase Locking (Strict 2PL)
		   - Definition: A stricter version of 2PL where a transaction holds all its exclusive locks until it commits or aborts.
		   - Purpose: To prevent cascading rollbacks, where a single transaction's failure causes multiple other transactions to fail.
		   - Example: Continuing with the flight and hotel booking, you hold the exclusive locks on both reservations until the entire transaction is completed or canceled, ensuring no other transaction can interfere.

		3. Rigorous Two-Phase Locking
		   - Definition: An even stricter version where all locks (both shared and exclusive) are held until the transaction commits or aborts.
		   - Purpose: To provide even stronger guarantees of isolation and prevent any interference during the transaction.
		   - Example: In the flight and hotel booking scenario, you hold both shared and exclusive locks on all related data until the booking process is fully complete or canceled.

		4. Optimistic Concurrency Control
		   - Definition: Assumes that conflicts between transactions are rare. Transactions execute without acquiring locks and validate their changes before committing.
		   - Purpose: To improve performance by reducing the overhead of acquiring and releasing locks.
		   - Example: You make tentative changes to your flight and hotel bookings without locking the records. Before finalizing, the system checks if any conflicts occurred. If there are no conflicts, the changes are committed; otherwise, the transaction is retried.

		5. Timestamp Ordering
		   - Definition: Transactions are assigned timestamps when they start. The protocol ensures that older transactions (with smaller timestamps) get priority over newer ones.
		   - Purpose: To maintain a consistent order of transactions based on their start time, preventing conflicts.
		   - Example: If two users try to book the same hotel room, the user who started the booking process first (has an older timestamp) will get priority.

	Why These Protocols Matter

		Concurrency lock protocols ensure that transactions:
		- Do not interfere with each other, maintaining data consistency and integrity.
		- Follow the ACID properties, especially Isolation, ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state.
		- Prevent common concurrency issues like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

	In summary, concurrency lock protocols are essential for managing simultaneous database access, ensuring that transactions do not conflict and that the database remains reliable and consistent.
	



Read Anomalies in Databases:

	In the context of database transactions, read anomalies refer to inconsistencies or issues that can arise when multiple transactions are running concurrently. Here's a breakdown of some common types:

	1. Dirty Read

		- Definition: A dirty read occurs when a transaction reads data that has been modified by another transaction but not yet committed. If the other transaction rolls back, the data read by the first transaction becomes invalid.
		- Problem: If the other transaction is rolled back, the data read by the first transaction becomes invalid, leading to inconsistencies.
		- Example: Transaction A updates a record but has not committed the change yet. Transaction B reads the updated record. If Transaction A then rolls back, the changes are discarded, but Transaction B has already read and possibly acted on this invalid data.

	2. Non-Repeatable Read

		- Definition: A non-repeatable read happens when a transaction reads the same record multiple times, and the data changes between these reads due to another transaction’s updates. This means that the results of the reads are not consistent within the same transaction.
		- Problem: The transaction sees different values on subsequent reads, leading to inconsistencies within the same transaction.
		- Example: Transaction A reads a record, and before it completes, Transaction B updates that record and commits. If Transaction A reads the record again, it sees different data compared to the initial read, leading to inconsistencies.
	
	3. Phantom Read

		- Definition: A phantom read occurs when a transaction reads a set of rows that match a certain condition, but another transaction inserts, updates, or deletes rows that affect the result of the original query.
		- Problem: The result set of the query can change during the transaction due to the addition or removal of rows by other transactions.
		- Example: Transaction A queries the database for records where the age is greater than 30. Transaction B inserts a new record where the age is 35 and commits. If Transaction A runs the same query again, it now includes the new record that was not there before.
			
	Key Differences

		- Dirty Read: Involves reading data that is not yet committed and may be rolled back. This affects the accuracy of the data read.
		- Non-Repeatable Read: Involves reading the same data multiple times within the same transaction and seeing different values because another transaction has modified the data.
		- Phantom Read: Occurs when a transaction reads a set of rows that match a certain condition, but another transaction inserts, updates, or deletes rows that affect the result of the original query.
	Isolation Levels and Read Anomalies

		- Read Uncommitted: Allows dirty reads.
		- Read Committed: Prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads.
		- Repeatable Read: Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads but may still allow phantom reads.
		- Serializable: Prevents all three read anomalies (dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads).

	These isolation levels and the associated read anomalies highlight the trade-offs between data consistency and system performance in concurrent transaction environments.
	
	
	
	
### Isolation Levels

	Isolation levels define how transactions are isolated from each other in a database, affecting data consistency and concurrency. 
	Here's a brief overview of the main isolation levels:

	1. Read Uncommitted
	   - Definition: Transactions can read uncommitted changes made by other transactions.
	   - Pros: Highest level of concurrency.
	   - Cons: Can lead to dirty reads (reading uncommitted data).
	   - Example: You can see changes made by others even if they haven’t been finalized yet.

	2. Read Committed
	   - Definition: Transactions can only read committed changes made by other transactions.
	   - Pros: Prevents dirty reads.
	   - Cons: Can lead to non-repeatable reads (data might change between reads within the same transaction).
	   - Example: You can only read data that has been committed by other transactions, but data might change if read multiple times.

	3. Repeatable Read
	   - Definition: Ensures that if a transaction reads a record, it will see the same value if it reads that record again, preventing non-repeatable reads.
	   - Pros: Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads.
	   - Cons: Can lead to phantom reads (new records might appear or disappear between reads).
	   - Example: If you read a record, it will remain the same throughout your transaction, but new records might still appear.

	4. Serializable
	   - Definition: Provides the highest level of isolation, ensuring that transactions are executed in a way that produces the same result as if they were executed serially (one after another).
	   - Pros: Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
	   - Cons: Lowest concurrency, as transactions are effectively executed one at a time.
	   - Example: Transactions are processed in a completely isolated manner, ensuring complete consistency.

	### Summary

	- Read Uncommitted: Allows dirty reads, highest concurrency.
	- Read Committed: Prevents dirty reads, but allows non-repeatable reads.
	- Repeatable Read: Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads, but allows phantom reads.
	- Serializable: Prevents all read anomalies, but has the lowest concurrency.

	Isolation levels balance between data consistency and system performance.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
 SQL 

What is SQL:

	- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. 
	- It allows users to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, and managing database structures. 
	- SQL is essential for interacting with relational databases and performing operations on data.
	
	
Keywords and Identifiers

### Keywords

	- Definition: Keywords are reserved words in SQL or programming languages that have a predefined meaning and purpose. They form the syntax and structure of SQL statements and cannot be used for other purposes like naming variables or tables.

	- Purpose: Keywords dictate the operations you can perform, such as querying data, defining structure, or controlling transactions.

	- Examples in SQL:
	  - `SELECT`: Used to query data from a table.
		sql
		SELECT * FROM Employees;
		
	  - `INSERT`: Used to add new records into a table.
		sql
		INSERT INTO Employees (Name, Department) VALUES ('Alice', 'HR');
		
	  - `UPDATE`: Used to modify existing records.
		sql
		UPDATE Employees SET Department = 'Finance' WHERE Name = 'Alice';
		
	  - `DELETE`: Used to remove records from a table.
		sql
		DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Name = 'Alice';
		
	  - `CREATE TABLE`: Used to define a new table.
		sql
		CREATE TABLE Employees (ID INT, Name VARCHAR(50), Department VARCHAR(50));
		

### Identifiers

	- Definition: Identifiers are names used to uniquely identify database objects such as tables, columns, indexes, and views. They are user-defined and can be customized according to the needs of the database schema.

	- Purpose: Identifiers help in referring to specific database objects within SQL statements.

	- Examples in SQL:
	  - Table Name: `Employees` in the `CREATE TABLE` statement.
		sql
		CREATE TABLE Employees (ID INT, Name VARCHAR(50), Department VARCHAR(50));
		
	  - Column Name: `Name` and `Department` in the `Employees` table.
		sql
		SELECT Name, Department FROM Employees;
		
	  - Index Name: `IDX_EmployeeName` (if you create an index for optimizing searches).
		sql
		CREATE INDEX IDX_EmployeeName ON Employees (Name);
		

### Summary

	- Keywords: Reserved words with specific meanings in SQL that form the commands and structure of SQL statements (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

	- Identifiers: User-defined names for database objects such as tables, columns, and indexes (e.g., `Employees`, `Name`, `Department`).

	Keywords are predefined and fixed in SQL, while identifiers are flexible and can be chosen by the user to best fit the schema and design of the database.

Assignment 1: Analyze a given business scenario and create an ER diagram that includes entities, relationships, attributes, and cardinality. 
Ensure that the diagram reflects proper normalization up to the third normal form.

Assignment 2: Design a database schema for a library system, including tables, fields, and constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK. 
Include primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.

Assignment 3: Explain the ACID properties of a transaction in your own words. Write SQL statements to simulate a transaction that includes locking and 
demonstrate different isolation levels to show concurrency control.

Assignment 4: Write SQL statements to CREATE a new database and tables that reflect the library schema you designed earlier. 
Use ALTER statements to modify the table structures and DROP statements to remove a redundant table.

Assignment 2: Demonstrate the creation of an index on a table and discuss how it improves query performance. 
Use a DROP INDEX statement to remove the index and analyze the impact on query execution.
